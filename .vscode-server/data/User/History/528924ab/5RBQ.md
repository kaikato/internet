Checkpoint 6 Writeup
====================

My name: Kai Kato

My SUNet ID: kaiykato 

I collaborated with: krainc

This checkpoint took me about 1 hours to do. I did not attend the lab session.

Solo portion:

- Did your implementation successfully start and end a conversation with another copy of itself? y

- Did it successfully transfer a one-megabyte file, with contents identical upon receipt? y

- Please describe what code changes, if any, were necessary to pass these steps: No code changes necessary

Group portion:

- Who is your lab partner (and what is their SUNet ID, e.g. "winstein"? krainc

- Did your implementations successfully start and end a conversation with each other (with each implementation acting as ``client'' or as ``server'')? Yes.

- Did you successfully transfer a one-megabyte file between your two
  implementations, with contents identical upon receipt? Yes.

- Please describe what code changes, if any, were necessary to pass
  these steps, either by you or your lab partner. No code changes needed.

Creative portion (if you did anything for our creative challenge,
                  please boast about it!)

- Optional: I had unexpected difficulty with: Thinking something was broken when waiting for the file to send.
